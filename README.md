# ZWUtils-VCPP
This utility library provides basic run-time services, such as log management, configuration loading and saving, thread synchronization primitive and objects, memory debugging support, etc. to Microsoft Visual C++ applications.

It is a Visual C++ incarnation of the same principle in [ZWUtils-Java](https://github.com/Adam5Wu/ZWUtils-Java) -- simple to use and gets the job done, and **let your code be the master piece of your application**.

# Acknowledgement
